  <!-- 1. Introduction -->
  <div id="introduction" class="cs-div">
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <div>
      Recent nutritional research, particularly the
      <em>Hyperfoods</em>framework, shows that everyday ingredients contain
      molecules linked to cancer prevention. Despite this progress, most
      consumers still make food choices based on calories or macronutrients,
      with limited visibility into the long-term health impact of ingredients
      and recipes.

      <div>
        This project developed a personalized food recommendation system that
        ranks everyday recipes by their potential cancer-beating properties,
        while adapting to individual taste preferences, cooking habits, and
        comfort levels. The system combines scientific scoring, recommender
        techniques, and a clean interface to make cancer-preventive eating
        practical and approachable.

      <!-- 2. The Challenge -->
      <div id="challenge" class="cs-div">
        <h2>2. The Challenge</h2>
        <h3>
          Existing “healthy eating” tools suffer from several limitations:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Binary nutrition labels:</strong>Recipes are categorized as
            “healthy” or “unhealthy” without deeper, ingredient-level insight.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lack of personalization:</strong>Taste, culture, budget, and
            cooking comfort are rarely integrated into recommendations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Weak connection to research:</strong>Scientific findings on
            cancer-beating molecules are not translated into everyday food
            decisions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        The goal of the system was to bridge this gap by combining
        cancer-related nutrition science with recommender systems and an
        intuitive user experience.
      </div>

      <!-- 3. Approach & Strategy -->
      <div id="approach" class="cs-div">
        <h2>3. Approach &amp; Strategy</h2>
        The solution was guided by three design principles:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Scientific validity:</strong>Construct a defensible
            recipe-level score from ingredient-level cancer-beating molecule
            data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Personal relevance:</strong>Reflect each user's flavor
            preferences, cuisines, and everyday cooking habits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Simplicity and trust:</strong>Present complex models through
            clear, understandable UI affordances and feedback loops.
          </li>
        </ol>
        These principles shaped both the architecture of the recommendation
        engine and the design of the user interface.
      </div>

      <!-- 4. System Architecture -->
      <div id="architecture" class="cs-div">
        <h2>4. System Architecture</h2>
        The system uses a hybrid recommendation approach that combines
        content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and a cancer-beating
        molecule score (CBMS) to rank recipes.

        <!-- Architecture diagram placeholder -->
        <img
          src="/assets/img/projects/food-recommender/6.png"
          alt="Diagram of hybrid recommender architecture combining content-based, collaborative filtering, and cancer-beating score"
        />High-level architecture: content-based and collaborative filtering
        blocks feed into a cancer-beating molecule scoring block, which outputs
        a final ranked list of recipes. In the architecture, a content-based
        (CB) module filters recipes based on explicit preferences and ingredient
        attributes, while a collaborative filtering (CF) module leverages taste
        proximity between users. Both modules output preference scores which are
        then combined, filtered against user history, and enriched with the CBMS
        to produce a final recommendation list.
      </div>

      <!-- 5. Personalization & Taste Modeling -->
      <div id="personalization" class="cs-div">
        <h2>5. Personalization &amp; Taste Modeling</h2>
        Personalization relies on a structured representation of taste. The
        system captures:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Flavor intensities (e.g., spicy, sweet, savory, smoky, sour, umami)
          </li>
          <li>Preferred cuisines (e.g., Italian, Japanese, Mediterranean)</li>
          <li>Frequently used ingredients and familiar dishes</li>
          <li>
            Explicit feedback via likes, favorites, and “not for me” actions
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Taste Profile UI -->
        <img
          src="/assets/img/projects/food-recommender/3.png"
          alt="Taste profile UI with flavor sliders and preferred cuisines"
        />Taste Profile screen capturing long-term flavor preferences and
        preferred cuisines, used as input into the content-based recommender.
        These inputs are used to construct a user taste profile, which drives
        content-based recommendations and serves as a feature vector for
        collaborative filtering. This structure helps the system stay aligned
        with what users actually enjoy, rather than only what is nutritionally
        optimal.
      </div>

      <!-- 6. Scoring Framework: CBMS -->
      <div id="scoring" class="cs-div">
        <h2>6. Cancer-Beating Molecule Score (CBMS)</h2>
        A central component of the system is the Cancer-Beating Molecule Score
        (CBMS), which estimates how strongly a recipe aligns with
        cancer-preventive nutritional patterns. Because no existing dataset
        directly maps recipes to such scores, a multi-step scoring framework was
        developed:

        <ol>
          <li>
            Map ingredients in a recipe to cuisine and ingredient categories.
          </li>
          <li>
            Associate cuisines and ingredients with cancer-beating molecule data
            derived from Hyperfoods.
          </li>
          <li>
            Weight contributions based on ingredient prominence and quantity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust for preparation methods that may reduce or preserve
            beneficial compounds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Normalize scores to allow fair comparison across different cuisines.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Recipe detail modal with CBMS -->

          alt="Recipe detail modal showing cancer-beating score, rating, and ingredients"
        />Recipe detail view surfacing the Cancer-Beating Score (e.g., 94/100)
        alongside ratings, exclusion toggle, and ingredient details, making the
        underlying nutrition model visible to users. The CBMS is independent of
        personal taste and is later combined with preference scores in the
        ranking layer, ensuring that every recommendation meets a minimum health
        standard.
      </div>

      <!-- 7. Recommendation Experience -->
      <div id="recommendation-experience" class="cs-div">
        <h2>7. Recommendation Experience</h2>
        The final recommendation pipeline merges taste and health signals into a
        single score for each candidate recipe. The system:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Generates candidate recipes from content-based and collaborative
            filtering modules.
          </li>
          <li>
            Removes recipes previously disliked or already shown frequently.
          </li>
          <li>Combines preference scores with CBMS via a weighted formula.</li>
          <li>Ranks recipes to produce a personalized, health-aligned list.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Recommendation feed UI -->

          alt="Recommendation feed showing recipes with health scores"
        />Recommendation feed showing a balance of familiar dishes and new
        options, each annotated with a cancer-beating score to support informed
        choices. This ranked list keeps users within a comfortable flavor range
        while nudging them toward recipes with stronger cancer-preventive
        profiles.

      <!-- 8. User Trust & Error Correction -->
      <div id="trust" class="cs-div">
        <h2>8. User Trust &amp; Error Correction</h2>
        Since the system can ingest images of meals and infer recipes, handling
        misclassifications is critical for trust. A dedicated correction flow
        allows users to confirm or change detected recipes when the model
        prediction is inaccurate.

        <!-- Scanner correction UI -->
        <img
          src="/assets/img/projects/food-recommender/5.png"
          alt="Recipe scanner correction UI allowing users to fix an incorrect detection"
        />Recipe scanner correction dialog that lets users override incorrect
        detections and select the correct recipe, closing the loop between model
        predictions and real-world usage. This human-in-the-loop mechanism
        improves data quality over time and makes the system more transparent
        and reliable for users.

        <h2>9. Outcomes</h2>
        <h3>Functional Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Recommended recipes consistently surfaced high cancer-beating scores
            while remaining aligned with user taste profiles.
          </li>
          <li>

        <h3>Qualitative Feedback</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Suggestions felt “close to what I usually cook, but slightly
            healthier.”
          </li>
          <li>
            The cancer-beating score made the scientific layer feel concrete and
            understandable.
          </li>
          <li>
            The correction flow increased confidence that the system would learn
            and improve over time.

      <!-- 10. Key Takeaways -->
      <div id="takeaways" class="cs-div">
        <h2>10. Key Takeaways</h2>
        The project illustrates how evidence-based science, recommender systems,
        and UX can work together to enable healthier behavior without forcing
        drastic lifestyle changes. Key learnings include:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Scoring frameworks must balance technical rigor with
            interpretability to be meaningful for end users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personalization is most effective when it incorporates both explicit
            preferences and behavior-derived patterns.
          </li>
          <li>
            Human-in-the-loop mechanisms are essential in ML-driven products to
            maintain trust and improve data quality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradual, “adjacent” suggestions are more impactful than radical
            changes when encouraging healthier habits.
