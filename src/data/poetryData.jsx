    content: `I am hidden,
beneath layers of uncountable lies
Drowning;
I try to come up,
have a breath of fresh air
But often suppressed
to please some self-centered asshole
Its not my fault that i'm hard hitting
or that people fear me
They want me but they still don't prefer me
Deep down, all of them wonder
what I am like
But they're scared
to face me;
to face someone else;
So I stay down,
for moments, minutes and years
Until one day
someone comes along and beats me out
Not literally, no
And once i'm free
I perish
I go, but I change the world
in that one second that I am out,
No, I'm not the truth of the matter,
or an indisputable fact,
I am just... an Honest Opinion.`,

    content: `Some hold onto it
some give it
Some ignore it
And some fit it
It comes to us in the happiest of the moments
It leaves us in a fleeting stance
It holds onto us
And we hold onto it
I'm an addict of it
could never admit it was a drug
The high is real
And all doors are closed
It strips me away of my defences
And i stand there naked
and vulnerable
And it touches me in an intimate
yet comforting way
And then it leaves… give away.
And all there's left is me
standing alone.... devastated .... broken
and begging for it to come back
In all Its faces and lies
for even though it hollows me
it gives me the skies
False hope some say
Delusional desire of mind they may be
Denial at its prime
But it is no crime.`,

    content: `What we had wasn't perfect
It was:
sunshine lined with darkness,
liberty bound with shackles,
smiles laced with pain,
Lucid, yet still insane
What we had was raw
It was:
truth every time you lied,
fidelity every time I deceived,
a yes every time you denied,
Affection everytime we fucked.
It was consuming with you
All powerful but still too vulnerable
And as I watched our demons and angels dance together
I realised
It was honest with you
All hidden but still all bare.`,

    content: `Kisses and hugs,
Sex and drugs,
Coffee and date,
A full fucking plate.
We start walking,
In silence, no talking,
Thoughts in mind,
Memories rewind.
Hand in hand,
Together in sand,
Smiles and laughter,
A budding disaster.
I fall for that smile,
And Like many others,
I'm left as a bird,
With broken feathers.`,

    content: `You meet as stranger
You talk like one
Caution evident in tone
Scared to trust,
but also to be alone.
Then you get familiar
and the strings unwind,
from around your heart;
giving way,
to a little bright start.
You talk and text,
and joke
starts as a spark, 
then fire then smoke.
You put your trust in them,
and hope,
they keep it safe;
not lost, not broke.
You get attached,
yearning to see their faces
they're your comfort
your support
in far off places.
They remind you of home sometimes,
of all the smiles
and laughter
and fun;
And a heavy pain falls on your chest,
weighing a ton.
You try to get away,
but you always moves closer,
cause they are the sanity,
the strength;
that keeps you together,
and makes you strong.
And then you start fearing,
about losing them,
about them leaving you,
about them being led away.
You start getting insecure,
about them finding better,
about them realising better,
about them deserving better.
And in that moment, you realise
they've become your family,
bound together with love and pride.`,

Maybe not
Maybe you're a fantasy 
He dreams of
Magic is inside
We've all believed
Maybe it's infact alive
We've perceived 
Maybe there are witches and wizards
Maybe there are those
Imaginary creatures
Maybe werewolves exists too
Maybe not
The story is true
Or maybe twist of thoughts
Maybe a world exists
With quiddich players
Maybe death does make us
See invisible clears
Maybe it's not chess
Ron plays with
Maybe it's you
He toys with
Maybe it's not a story
We've read
Maybe it's a tale
We're part of
Maybe it's not about chosen one
Maybe its about mending broken one
With tales recalled
Or stories formulated
Maybe imagination
Or maybe calculated
Maybe not real
Maybe not true
But still binds us together
Like a Weasley's glue.`,

    content: `Lost and found
Silence and sound
The latter I preffered
The former profound
This year
I'd say,
I found too much
That,
I lost count,
I found that I'm not the one
To be part of a useless race
I'd rather be alone
And find my own place.
I met people that I connected with
But I lost some too, 
Cuz life doesn't wait
Neither for me nor for you. 
I discovered a side of me
I never knew existed
A part of me
That wants to accept
The decisions I've taken
Wants to mend
Bonds I've broken
Patience and perseverance
I never thought relevant
Are helping me today
In some time some way every day. 
I met new people
Some I love
Some I don't even like
Some I admire
Some I may even depise
Some who inspire to do good in life
Some who shake faith and create a nasty ride
Some I don't think I can ever part
Some I feel like I can start a war
Some I share, my deepest fears with
Some who spark an annoyance at par with mountain peak
Some who I think need me
Some who I believe I need
Some who show me, it's easy to be kind
Some I learn from, it's better being blind
These days
Life is conflicted
Trust is restricted
Day is shaken
Faith is taken
Found I have
Passion of thy soul
Lost I did
Hope of whole, 
Found I have
Friends who I adore
Lost I have
Love that slipped my hold
But over an over
A new ray shines
Taking a leap of faith
To flourish, 
Hopes this blind.`,

    content: `Isolation,
a peculiar prison
It lets me leave,
but I don't want to
It lets me stay,
in a space made of nothing
It hides me,
from the worst of me,
but also from the best of me
It lets me be alive,
without actually living
It lets me scream,
of my demons,
but it silences me,
from my angels,
and I don't know how,
to be anchored,
to something that doesn't exist
how to break shackles,
I can feel,
but shackles I can't see.
how to breathe
without my lungs choking
from the overwhelming feeling of suffocation.
So I stay,
I stay put,
within the air that thrums of iron bars
and feels of an electric whip,
and I endure,
I endure this painless, painful existence.`,

    content: `In the days of crayon and glitter,
I was dealing with the taste of bitter
In a world meant to welcome,
I got nothing but a bowl of venom
In a family that was to protect,
I was told I was a defect
In a school meant for education,
I was left feeling just desolation,
and all for what?
For their want of a boy,
my dreams did they destroy
for their dislike of the quiet,
I grew up in a riot,
for their demand of obedience,
I got whipped for experience,
and all it did?
Left me with just
growing and growing resentment.`,

    content: `There are days
when I sit by the window
and watch people leave—
first in crowds,
then pairs,
then one by one.
Each goodbye took
a little more light,
like bulbs burning out
in a string of stars
until the room grew dim
with missing voices.
I've gotten good
at talking to shadows,
at pretending screens
and distant voices
are enough to fill
these hollow spaces.
"It's better this way,"
I tell my reflection—
no disappointments,
no messy goodbyes,
no plans that fall through.
Just quiet. Just me.
But sometimes at night
when the walls close in
and my phone stays dark,
I remember how it felt
to share a silence
that wasn't empty.
These four walls know
all my practiced smiles,
all my small brave lies
about being fine alone.
They know, too, how I search
for footsteps at my door,
But I've learned that hope
is heaviest when it doesn't walk through.`,
